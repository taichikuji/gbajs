<h1>Taichi's Arcade Store!</h1>

This is a small project for me to practice html, css, and javascript. Especially the last two of them.
I didn't do the emulator's core, but i plan on doing it from scratch in the future. For now i'll just try to fix the issues that this one has and keep it as "mine" as possible.

# Ideas and TODO

- [x] Changed overall look of website
- [x] Fix savegames
- [ ] Add new js (new functions for the website, already in the process)
