<h1>Taichi's Arcade Store!</h1>

This is a small project for me to practice html, css, and javascript. Especially the last two of them.
I didn't do the emulator's core, but i plan on doing it from scratch in the future. For now i'll just try to fix the issues that this one has and keep it as "mine" as possible.

# Ideas and TODO

- [x] Changed overall look of website
- [x] Fix savegames (✅ **COMPLETED** - See [QUICK_START.md](QUICK_START.md) for usage guide)
- [ ] Add new js (new functions for the website, already in the process)

## Savegame Functionality

The savegame system has been completely fixed and enhanced! Features include:

- ✅ Automatic saves during gameplay
- ✅ Auto-save on page close/refresh
- ✅ Manual "Store Savegame" button
- ✅ Download/Upload save files
- ✅ Robust error handling
- ✅ Clear user feedback

**Documentation:**

- [SAVEGAME_FIXES.md](SAVEGAME_FIXES.md) - Technical details
- [IMPLEMENTATION_SUMMARY.md](IMPLEMENTATION_SUMMARY.md) - Complete overview
